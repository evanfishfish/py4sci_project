    "SMiPoly, short for Small Molecules into Polymers, is a Python-based library designed to generate virtual libraries of synthesizable polymers by applying rule-based polymerization reactions. It facilitates the discovery of functional polymers by automating the creation of polymer structures based on predefined chemical rules. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Functionality\n",
    "SMiPoly operates through two main submodules:\n",
    "\n",
    "monc.py: This module classifies monomers from a list of small molecules. It identifies polymerizable functional groups and categorizes the molecules into 19 different monomer classes based on their chemical structure and compatibility with 22 predefined polymerization reaction rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "polg.py: This module generates polymer repeating units by applying functional group transformations dictated by the applicable polymerization reaction rules. It can handle one or two starting monomers to create polymers belonging to seven molecular types, including polyolefins, polyesters, polyethers, polyamides, polyimides, polyurethanes, and polyoxazolidones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "The SMiPoly library follows a systematic workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monomer Identification: Starting molecules are analyzed for the presence of functional groups compatible with polymerization reactions. Molecules without suitable functional groups are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: The identified monomers are classified into specific categories based on their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymer Generation: Monomers or pairs of monomers are mapped to applicable polymerization reactions to generate repeating units. The resulting polymers are represented using SMILES notation, with connecting points marked for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capabilities\n",
    "SMiPoly implements 22 common polymerization reactions, including addition and condensation reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using 1,083 readily available monomers, it has generated a virtual library of 169,347 unique polymers, significantly expanding the scope of known polymer structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated polymers exhibit high novelty (53%) and coverage (48%) compared to approximately 16,000 real-world synthesized polymers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "SMiPoly is particularly useful in:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accelerating de novo polymer synthesis by streamlining the selection of synthesizable candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporting molecular design workflows for material discovery in areas such as sustainability and advanced manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By automating the process of virtual polymer generation, SMiPoly addresses challenges in identifying synthetic routes for designed polymers and enhances computational polymer research."

    "SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a widely used notation for representing chemical structures in a compact, human-readable format. It encodes the structure of molecules as ASCII strings, which can be easily processed by computational tools. Here's an explanation of SMILES and its relevance to SMiPoly:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SMILES?\n",
    "SMILES is a linear notation system that describes molecular structures using simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "Atoms: Represented by their atomic symbols (e.g., C for carbon, O for oxygen). Brackets are used for atoms with non-standard bonding or charges (e.g., [OH-] for hydroxide).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds: Single bonds are implied, while double (=), triple (#), and aromatic (:) bonds are explicitly denoted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches: Parentheses indicate branching points in the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rings: Numbers are used to denote ring closures by connecting atoms in the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethanol: CCO\n",
    "\n",
    "Benzene: c1ccccc1\n",
    "\n",
    "SMILES strings are compact and can encode both connectivity and stereochemistry of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How SMILES Relates to SMiPoly\n",
    "SMiPoly relies heavily on SMILES for its operations, as it uses these strings to represent monomers, functional groups, and polymer repeating units. Here’s how SMILES integrates into SMiPoly's workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The small organic molecules provided as input to SMiPoly are expressed in SMILES format. This allows the software to interpret and manipulate molecular structures efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monomer Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "The monc.py submodule analyzes the SMILES strings of input molecules to identify polymerizable functional groups and classify them into specific monomer categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymer Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The polg.py submodule uses SMILES transformations to simulate polymerization reactions. It generates repeating units of polymers by modifying the functional groups in the input monomers according to predefined chemical rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting polymers are represented as SMILES strings with marked connecting points (e.g., using asterisks *) to indicate where polymerization occurs. This ensures compatibility with other cheminformatics tools for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using SMILES in SMiPoly\n",
    "Compactness: SMILES strings require less storage space compared to other molecular representations, making them ideal for handling large datasets like virtual polymer libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interoperability: Many cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit) can parse and manipulate SMILES, enabling seamless integration with computational workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: SMILES can encode a wide range of molecular structures, including those with stereochemistry or complex functional groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the simplicity and versatility of SMILES, SMiPoly efficiently classifies monomers and generates synthesizable polymers, accelerating material discovery processes"
